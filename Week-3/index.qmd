# Introduction

::: notes
In Module 3.1, we're going to talk about users and information seeking
behavior. This becomes very important to us: one, as someone who's
helping users find information in retrieval systems, but also for those
that design information systems and databases that help users connect
with information.

In this multi-lecture topic, we will first talk about users and their
information behavior broadly, but also why it is important that we
understand users to provide them with better organized collections and
organization systems.

In Module 3.2, we will learn more about information retrieval and
user-centered design and how these both relate to information
organization and users.

In Module 3.3, which is an optional lecture, I will introduce you to
some tips and advanced search techniques to use in information retrieval
systems, like OU Libraries' databases.
:::

## Important Questions

-   `Who are Users?`
-   `What can we know about Users?`
-   `How do users seek and search for information?`
    -   Examples of models for search and information seeking behavior

::: notes
So let's talk about our users. Some questions to frame our thinking:

-   Who are our users?
-   What can we know about users?
-   How do users seek and search for information?

We will also look at some different models that have been developed in
Library and Information Science \[LIS\] through the years, primarily
starting in the 1980s about how users look for information. So, these
are some questions to help frame our thinking. Let's talk about each of
these aspects individually.
:::

## Who Are Users?

`A user is a person who uses information and/or information systems in some meaningful way`

::: notes
First, let's look at "Who are our users?"

A user, very broadly defined, is "a person who uses information and/ or
information systems in some meaningful way."

Now, meaningful is a very subjective term, and you're thinking "what
does she mean by meaningful?"

And generally, it's up to the user to decide if their interaction with
the system has been useful.

Now, I'm not just talking about automated systems, technical systems.
I'm talking about systems in general.

You know, walking into the library and talking to a reference librarian
would be part of a system's interaction. I'll explain that in just a few
minutes, but users are anyone that really uses our system to find what
they're looking for, to solve an information need. And there are lots of
different terms that you're going to see in the literature that refer to
users.

In the 80's and the 90's we've called them "patrons" and "end users" and
"system users". We used to refer to librarians, specifically reference
librarians, as search intermediaries, so you might see that in the
literature, but that was primarily in the late 80's and early 90's. But
now we just call them users.

:::

::: notes
Okay, so who exactly is today's user?

I've given you some pictures on this slide to think through what a user
or who a user is, but one thing that you'll notice, of course, is that
there is either a computerized or virtual or a print based technology in
place in each of these pictures.

You will notice, computers, much of what you would see in most of the
libraries today with various different people of different genders or
ages accessing the Internet or using computer systems within their
library context.

You also have to think about users in terms of age groups. We have young
users that are interacting with and adapting technology in ways that we
did not anticipate, which is very exciting for us as library and
information professionals, but it's also very challenging because we now
have to think about how do we engage with the users and help them become
better information consumers as well as creators of information.

And we cannot forget that people still like to browse our libraries.
People traditionally are used to going through the stacks, finding
something they like and then looking at the books around the book to
determine if there's something else that they find of interest or that's
related to their information need. So, classification systems are still
very relevant in libraries. That's not to say that the systems in place
are the best systems or the most user-friendly systems for this new
generation of user, but they do still support users in very important
ways.

A really interesting dimension of users, and this came about, of course,
with the Internet and more social ways of sharing information or
participating in online communities, is what is being called "citizen
science".

Also, we have very wired individuals as users today where a user is
connected to internet 24/7. These users are using different tools like
smartphones or tablets in ways that allow them to access information but
also to share and create information and engage in different practices
with other users. These are all dimensions of users we as information
professionals have to think about.
:::

## Model of Today's User

> [*Work in Progress?!*]{style="color: blue;"}

::: notes
So, when we think about today's users, it's really difficult to model
the user today because of all the different technology that they
interact with on a daily basis and all the different resources they have
available to them at their fingertips.

So, let's think about the user as a "work in progress" as we work
through this lecture on users and information behavior.
:::

## Some More Vocabulary

-   `Information`: any difference you perceive in your environment or
    within yourself
-   `Information need`: recognition that your knowledge is inadequate to
    satisfy a goal you have
-   `Information seeking`: conscious effort to acquire information in
    response to a need or gap in your knowledge
-   `Information behavior`: information seeking, as well as other
    unintentional or passive behaviors, or other purposive behaviors
    such as avoiding information

::: notes
Some other vocabulary that might be useful for understanding this
dimension of information seeking and organization of information.

In this program you will read lots of definitions of **information**.
One definition I find particularly useful is: *information is any
difference you perceive in your environment or within yourself*.

So, we can think of information in lots of different ways. We can think
of it as a cognitive change that comes about when we learn something new
or we encounter some new piece of information. We can think of
"information-as-thing," or as physical objects actually being thought of
as information bearing Or having the ability to inform us in some way.
So, there are lots of different ways we can think of information.

**Information need** then is that recognition that you have that your
knowledge is somewhat inadequate in a particular area and you need to
find something else out in order to satisfy a goal that you have. For
example, if you want to learn about designing webpages, you're probably
going to go to a class, or you're going to find a book that will help
you with this, or you might even go on the web and find different
information. But you're going to access systems, resources, in order to
find information to solve your information problem.

Another term is **information seeking**, and this is a conscious effort
to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your knowledge.
Think about your daily activities. Many of you probably got up this
morning, turned on a computer or tablet, turned on the television,
listened to the news, got information about the weather, so you could
decide what you're going to wear today or if you need an umbrella. You
probably have talked on the phone to someone today. At different points
during your day, you have been encountering or accessing different
systems to find information.

**Information behavior**, then, is kind of this overall umbrella of
information seeking as well as other unintentional or passive behaviors
or other purposeful behaviors related to seeking (or not seeking)
information, such as avoiding information.

Now, how many of you have heard of cognitive dissonance? It comes from
cognitive science. Cognitive dissonance is where you avoid information
that you know is going to change something that you've already made a
decision about or something that you've already done and you don't
really want to encounter that information because you know it's going to
make you feel bad about your decision. That's just one way of looking at
it. So, for example, you've just made a major purchase, like you bought
a new car. And then you get on the website or you hear consumer reports
or something telling you how bad that car is and that you really
shouldn't have bought it in the first place, and that's the idea of
avoiding information.

Also, it's interesting in our field because of what we call the
information glut, or the information overload. That people purposely
filter our information sources in their lives because they don't want to
be overwhelmed with all this different kinds of information. For
instance, I don't turn on the news before 8:00 because I don't want to
know what's going on until I'm ready for it.

But that's one way in which we avoid information. Turning off the radio
while you're driving, things like that. When we look at information
behavior, we look at not just purposeful information seeking, but we
look at avoidance activities as well.

So, it's a really interesting area of our field that tells us a lot
about people and how our information can be represented for them in
order to effect access to that information.

So, what do we need to know about the people we call our users?
:::

## What do We Need to Know?

-   `Demographics`
-   `Types & Levels of Knowledge`
-   `Information-Seeking Situations`

::: notes
Well, there are certain things we can know, and there are certain things
we can make some generalizations about, such as demographics, types and
levels of knowledge, and information seeking situations. Let's address
each of these separately.
:::

## Demographics

-   `Age`
-   `Gender`
-   `Education`
-   `Occupation`
-   `Culture` *(values, language, ethnicity)*

::: notes
**Age** is one way that we can get a good picture about a user group.
And we can characterize age in many different ways. Our society has
created these frameworks in order for us to do so. We can think about
age in terms of K-5, K-12, young adult, adult, senior citizen, children.
We put all these different labels on it. So, that's one way in which we
can get a handle on one characteristic of our user group.

Also, **gender**, are they primarily males and females? In earlier
studies of computer adoption studies this demographic was a real factor.
It's not as much today as it used to be, but again there are still
studies that show that males are heavier users of different kinds of
information technology than females are, but that's shifting.

What's really interesting about some of our studies today with gender is
that we're seeing that particularly in the web and in the internet
environment is that we have different uses -- that each gender has a
different use. Females tend to use more of the communicative aspects of
the web and internet than males. And males generally -- and I don't like
to generalize, but studies have shown this -- are more into the
information gathering and gaming and more of the high tech applications.

So it's kind of interesting what we can tell about a user population
based on the different variables. But this is shifting constantly.

**Education** can tell us a lot about a user group. It tells us about
their potential knowledge, about their subject and domain expertise; it
tells us about potential uses they might have for that information that
they're looking for. So, education level can tell us quite a bit.

**Occupation** is the same. If we know that someone is an engineer or
chemist or a contractor or a builder, they're going to have a different
knowledge base potentially. And so it's interesting to be able to tell
what their occupation is because that again will tell us something again
about what they're going to be looking for, what kind of resources would
be useful for them.

**Culture** is a little bit of a grayer area. But it does tell us a
little bit about values and ethnicity and ethnic choices that people
make. But also language. Especially if you're designing a system. You
need to know what kind of language or what languages your users need in
order to access your system. Is it a multilingual system? Do you have a
very heavy multilingual population, and how do we adapt that within the
system environment? So, even language can be a very important variable
to know about our users. We have a sparsity of studies related to
cultural aspects of information behavior and users.

# Types and Levels of Knowledge

[Allen (1991)](https://archive.org/details/informationtasks0000alle)

-   `World Knowledge`
-   `System Knowledge`
-   `Task Knowledge`
-   `Domain Knowledge`

::: notes
The second set of information that we can know about our users is what
we call "types and levels of knowledge":

-   world knowledge
-   system knowledge
-   task knowledge
-   domain knowledge

And others have expanded on this idea as well. So, let's break them each
down.
:::

## 1. World Knowledge

-   `World View, Perception of Self`

-   `Affects Self-Confidence`

::: notes
Now, we can look at them separately, but you can also see the
connections and the overlap between all these types of levels of
knowledge.

For example, **world knowledge** is a user's perception of themself and
the role that they play in the world -- in their own world. And it's
really a combination of the other three knowledge rolled into one. This
is kind of from a constructivist learning point of view -- that you
build or construct your own world based upon what you encounter, what's
in your society, and that frames and shapes your perception of yourself
and the role that you play.

Why this is important to us is that it will affect a user's
self-confidence when they're working with a particular system, when
they're looking for information, when they're coming to the reference
desk and asking questions. So, somebody with high world knowledge,
someone who has traveled a lot, someone who has a real broad view of the
world and different pieces of the world, and has a good sense of how
they *fit* in the world, is probably a more confident user of
information and information sources.
:::

## 2. System Knowledge

-   `Understanding of Information Environment`

> Information systems at some level (e.g. cultural, institutional,
> technical, interpersonal)

-   `Affects Skills and Expections`

::: notes
The second type of knowledge is a little bit more complex. This is
**system knowledge**, and this has been expanded upon by many people in
our field.

For example, Allen defines it as the understanding a user has of an
information environment. And this can mean many different things. This
can be an information system at any level -- not just a technical level.
It can be a cultural level -- how their community system works. Who do
you call if you need to find out if they're picking up your garbage on a
holiday? That's an example of your cultural system. An institutional
system would be something you know, "Who do I call if someone's put a
lock on my car wheel, so I can go home?" But you have to understand how
that institutional system might work.

Technical is related to knowledge of how the technical system works,
such as, "How does this database work? What can I do to make my search
effective?"

Interpersonal systems are your personal network. Who do you call if you
need a recipe for coffee cake? So, your own personal network, your
friends, your family, your colleagues.

Your understanding of system knowledge affects your skills and your
expectations when you're using different systems.

Okay, now let's expand this even further.
:::

## 2. System Knowledge (Cont.)

-   Conceptual knowledge of the information retrieval process - -
    *translating a need into a query*

-   Semantic knowledge of how to implement a query in a given system - -
    *the how and when to use the system features*

-   Technical skills in executing the query [(Borgman, 1996)](https://escholarship.org/content/qt3mz7h8hr/qt3mz7h8hr_noSplash_36344d4ac812b2c94219b90e4a164074.pdf?t=p7cad8)
    -   basic computing skills
    -   syntatic knowledge of query entry and how search statements,
        systems work 

::: notes
System knowledge includes many different aspects.

We can think of it as conceptual knowledge, we can think of it as
semantic knowledge, and we can think of it as technical skills. These
ideas were introduced by Christine Borgman in 1996 and they still hold
true today. Let's define each.

**Conceptual knowledge** is your understanding of an information
retrieval process -- translating your need into a query and eventually
implementing into a system.

**Semantic knowledge** is your understanding about how to implement a
query into a specific system -- or how do you input your query into a
given system. And how and when to use different system features.

For example, technical skills in inputting the query: your basic
computing skills, the syntax that you need in order to actually enter it
into the search box. Now, today we have it a little easier; we don't
have to use any command line searching. We don't have to put into our
OPACS anymore "A:\\" (A colon backslash) and then the author's last
name. And in most system's we don't even need to know if we need to
enter the last name, first name anymore. We've gotten very spoiled in
that way. But there are still a lot of systems out there that you really
have to know the syntax in order to enter a query to make the system
understand it.
:::

## 2.1 Conceptual Knowledge {.smaller}

- Going from the vaguely-felt need...
  - To the query formulation
      - verbally expressed
      - written or typed
      
- Query is formulated in terms of the... (Buckland, 1991)
  - Content *(words, numbers, symbols)*
  - Information Entities *(documents, objects)*
  - "Information as Thing" *(container of information)* 

- Successful query = translation of intended meaning into search terms

::: notes
Let's look at **conceptual knowledge**. Going from a vaguely felt need,
where we start to realize that we need some information about this
particular
topic
and "how can I find that information" to the idea of expressing that
query, either verbally where you go and ask somebody.

You ask a reference
librarian, call someone on the phone, text somebody on your phone, or type it
into a search engine, type it into a database, type it into an OPAC. We then
have to
understand how to formulate that query within our system. We
have to
be able to take our actual query and put it into terms that would be useful and
meaningful to either a human or a computerized system. 

And oftentimes, I'm
sure as you'll learn in 5053, your user doesn't really know what they want
when they come to talk to you. When they ask you a question at a reference
desk, they'll give you a
really big
, broad question, when they really need this
other subset of that actual query. After many years at a reference desk, I can
tell you, you get everything from A
-
Z. 

And oftentimes, you start very broadly
and eventually you drill down to what they need. But again, a user often
has to
go through that same process when they're seeking information.
:::

## 2.2 Semantic Knowledge

- `How to Implement a Query in the System`
- `How the System is Structured` *(file system used)*
- `Action` *(find, select, scan, browse)*
- `Access Points or Field Tags` *(author, title, subject)*
- `Search Terms` *(search functions of systesm: Boolean, Keyword)*
- `How the Search Results are Displayed`

::: notes
**Semantic knowledge** is again how to implement a query into a system. You have to know how that system is structured - what kinds of fields are in that system, what fields are searchable within a system, and the kinds of information that they would hold within those fields. 

You
have to
know the different actions
that are possible such as which fields are searchable and how to limit your
query to specific field(s) in the system you are using. Other aspects include, for
example, how we enter our search terms. What terms work, and as I said earlier,
what kind of functions are possible in the system? Do you have to use an AND
or a NOT Boolean string in order to make your search work, or can you just do
fielded
searching? Or if you're in a search engine, do you just put a couple of
terms into the magical box and see what you get?

You also
have to
know how the search results are displayed, and it's not as
difficult in some of the systems today, but remember in older systems, we had
all those function keys across the top? And if you hit F1, you could print. If you
hit F3, you could get a full
-
screen preview. Things like that. Our users again are
a little more spoiled than when we were learning different systems, but still,
they
have to
understand the different functionalities of a system. And if the
system isn't well
-
designed
-
if the navigation is difficult, or there are a lot of
necessary or unnecessary features that are not easily accessible
-
then our users
are also not going to be able to use our systems.
:::

## 2.3 Technical Skills

- We MUST not take for granted that all users know how to use computers
- How the computer operates
- Syntax of entering search commands
- Commands to manipulate system [(Borgman, 1996)](https://escholarship.org/content/qt3mz7h8hr/qt3mz7h8hr_noSplash_36344d4ac812b2c94219b90e4a164074.pdf?t=p7cad8)
    - control search
    - display formats
    - control output of results


::: notes
Technical skills - is the second aspect of System Knowledge.

We cannot take for granted that all our users know how to use computers.
Even in today's very highly wired web environment. Not all our users are
online. And not
all of
our users are proficient searchers. We, then, can't take
for granted some of the basic functions of a computer, such as how a keyboard
works.

Have you all heard the tech support story about the person that calls up and
says, "Well, it says to hit the 'any key,' but I can't find it on my keyboard.
Where's 'any key'?" We still get stories like that. Or the one where the
people were so happy because their new computer came with a cup holder
-
the CD drive? Thought it was for holding cups? Or even the one about the
mouse, where they tried to access their computer by pointing their mouse at
the screen? Or putting it down on the floor like a presser foot for a sewing
machine? 

These are true stories, and we still get them. 

So, we can't make
assumptions that everyone understands how to use our systems. 

Users base
their use of systems on previous experience they have had. For example, an
older user may be familiar with a presser foot when she used a sewing machine
so her mental model of how to use the mouse may be based on this prior
experience.

And as you all know, when you're learing new databases, you first
have to
navigate a
little bit. You
have to
look and see which kinds of fields are searchable, if it includes
Boolean searches or not, if there's any kind of proximity operators you can use to
make your queries more precise. 

Everyone
has to
go through the same kind of process
whenever you start using a new system. So, they may not understand how the
computer itself works, they may not know how to enter the query, and they may not
know the different commands to make the system do what they need.

And, honestly, even though these are
really interesting
, fun stories, we also need to
remember that our users don't have the background that we all do. They're not all
from a library science program, where this is what we learn. This is what we're here
for, is to learn how to connect our users with information.
:::

## 3. Task Knowledge

- `Understanding of Information Problem and Use`
- `Affects Motivation and Goals`

:::notes
The third type of knowledge is what we call **"task knowledge,"** and this is one
of the primary areas after domain knowledge that's
really essential
to know
about your users.

Task knowledge is an understanding a person has of their information problem
and use
-
how well your users understand what they need, what they're
looking for and how well they understand the kind of resources they might
need to use to find that information.

So, if we say that a user has high task knowledge, that means that they
understand very well what the query is that they have. 

They want to wallpaper
their kitchen, so they know that they want
some kind of book
that tells them
about home decoration. That's a really pretty good understanding of their task.

But say that they need to know about the ordinances in your city if they want
to build a house with a pitched roof. Where do you go for that kind of
information? To the city ordinances, or your planning department, but this is
not the kind of information every user will know.

But your users
have to
have a good understanding of the task itself and the
kind of resources that they need to answer that query. And they also need to
know how well your
collection
can help them answer that query. And this really affects our user's motivation and goal.  If they can't easily figure out what they
need, oftentimes, they will not go any further. They will leave the library or library
website unsatisfied and go to another source, such as a search engine.
:::

## 4. Domain Knowledge

- `Understanding of Topic and Topic Organization`
- `Affects Ability to Exploit Language and Association`


:::notes
The last area, and this is probably the most important, of the four types of
knowledge, is called **"domain knowledge."** This is our user's understanding of
the topic and the topic organization or the discipline of the topic and how that
discipline is structured. So, for example, if you're an undergraduate chemistry
student, how well at that point do you understand the discipline of chemistry?
Probably you have a
fairly basic
understanding, but not at the same level as
your professor or not at the same level as graduate students in the discipline.

This type of knowledge is important for us to know because if a user has a low
or a high domain knowledge, it gives us an understanding of their ability or
facility to use the language of that discipline. And when we're creating
representations, we would
make a decision
to use very specific terminology or
to use more general terminology based upon what we understand about their
domain knowledge. 

So, for example, if we're working with, again, a chemistry
database, we're assuming that our users are individuals that are in a program
of chemistry
-
they're either students or faculty
-
and we have varying levels
of domain knowledge. The students probably have a low to moderate level of
domain knowledge, whereas the faculty would probably have a higher level.
:::

## Example

`Collection`: Law Firm Library

`Demographics`: First Yer Law Clerks

`Information-Seeking Situations`: State Statute on Environmental Easements

`Types and Levels of Knowledge`: World, System, Task, Domain

:::notes
Here's an example on how we can apply what we've just been talking about.

Our collection is a law firm library. The demographics, we have first year law
clerks, so they've probably been to law school for one year. They're beginning
to know the language of their discipline; they're beginning to know how to
conduct research in the areas. They've probably taken at least one legal
research class. They're beginning to understand how to find information for
their
particular information
needs.

Our situation here is that they need to find information on a state statute on
what are called environmental easements, which is a law that tells you, for
example, can you have a pitched roof, or how close can you build to the water
on a beach. An easement is a stipulation of ownership and ownership building
rights in a particular tract of land, whether you own it, or if the government
owns it.

So, this is our situation. We have the law clerks; they probably have a pretty
good idea of how to go about finding out this information. They probably have
a probably moderate domain knowledge
-
moderate to low. Their system
knowledge will vary depending upon the systems they have used. And their
task knowledge is probably moderate to low at this point because they may not even know what an environmental easement is at that stage in their education, but
again it may vary as well.

Now, if we take the same situation and we put it in a
public library
, our users are
going to change. We're probably not going to have law clerks; we're going to have a
person who wants to build on the beach. And they need to know how close they're
allowed to build close to the dunes, for example. They're probably not going to have a
clue what an environmental easement is or even what a state statute is
-
very possible.
And
so
their task knowledge is going to be lower, their domain knowledge is going to
be lower, system knowledge depends on their experience, but all of those are going to
affect how they go about looking for information, the questions they ask you, the
resources they access and how they interact with different systems.


Okay, so can you see how those types and levels of knowledge and demographics can
change what we need to provide in terms of access? 

In a library - a public library - our records-
our representations -
are probably going to be at a very general level. We're
going to have one card in our catalog that represents our set of state statues if we're
fortunate enough to have them in a public library, which will have very general
subject headings. Now, in a law firm library, we're probably going to have a
breakdown of the different volumes of the state statute set that tells us what's in each
individual volume. But the language in our law firm collection is going to be at a
higher level of what we call of specificity
-
more specific terminology in use
-
than
what we might see in a public library.

So, the choices we make when we're designing
and creating representations will be different depending upon the environment,
depending upon the users, and their four types and levels of knowledge. That's why
types and levels of knowledge are so important to your understanding of organizing
information.
:::

## How Do User Seek and Search for Information?

- Users are motivated to seek information in a given situation to:
      - `answer a question`
      - `solve a problem`
      - `complete a task`
      - `learn about a subject`
      - `verify a fact`
      
:::notes
Alright, now let's talk about our next framing question: How do users seek and search for information?

As I've mentioned, there
are lots of different models that we've developed, as we've looked at
information seeking from lots of different perspectives. 

Users are motivated
for many different reasons to seek information: 

  - to answer a question;
  - to solve a
problem;
  - to complete a task;
  - to learn about a subject;
  - to verify a fact; and 

many
others I'm sure that you can think of!
:::

## How Do Users Seek & Search for Information?

- Two Situational Levels
  1. `Information Seeking`
    - Broad context involving any or all systems or sources accessed
  2. `Information Searching`
    - Narrow context involving interaction with specific system or source
    
    
:::notes
We can look at this also from two situational levels: (i) **information seeking**
and
(ii) **information searching**. And oftentimes in the literature, these two get used
interchangeably, but they're
really not
the same.

**Information seeking**
is kind of a broader context where we look at an
individual's entire information seeking activities
-
from all the different systems
that they use, from the beginning of their search to the end of their search and
the use of the information. That would be seeking.

**Searching**
is a
more narrow
context where we look at one specific interaction
with
either a
human system, a computerized system, any of those other forms
of systems that we discussed earlier. So, information seeking is a broader
context; information search is where we're looking at a specific narrow
situation.
:::

## What is Information Seeking?

It refers to the [user's process for obtaining information]{style="color: blue;"}, from recognition of an information need through use of information to resolve the information need.

:::notes
So, what is information seeking? Let's go back to that idea.

The information seeking is the whole process of user 
recognizing their information need --
that they
have a gap in their knowledge, to obtaining the information itself --
 that they need to know something about a
particular topic through the use of
different systems. 
:::

## Information Seeking: Assumptions

Common assumptions about information seeking in LIS are that the process is:

1. `Purposeful`
2. `Cognitive`
3. `Contextual`
4. `Value-Based`
5. `Dynamic`

:::notes
Now in our field, as well as other fields, we've made some different
assumptions about information seeking and the process itself
-
that it's
purposeful
(that we're always looking for information for a purpose). 

Now,
we're changing our idea about this because of the web. A lot of people just get
online and surf around.
And actually, we've
always been not just for a specific
purpose when we look for information. You go to the
library
and you just
browse the 'new book' shelf. You want to see what's been published. You're
not necessarily looking for
anything in particular
. Maybe the purpose is to find
something to read, but it's not necessarily linked to a specific information
need.

We've also assumed that it's a
*cognitive activity*
-
that we're always learning
as we encounter information.

That it's
*contextual*
and that your need will change depending on the different
context.

And actually, that
it's very
*dynamic*. That as you learn more about a particular
subject when you're searching, your need will change because you might
because more focused, or you might become even broader. You might go to a particular library OPAC looking for a particular subject and then you find other
subjects that are really
interesting
and you go off on more of a non
-
focused track. Or
you find a sub
-
piece of that topic, and that is really where you want to focus. So, your
need is changing as well as you go into the information seeking process.

And
*context*
is important because that will impact the way that you make decisions.

For example, if you need to do some research for your research paper and it's due in
three months, right now you'll use the web, you'll maybe use an OPAC. You might
even interlibrary loan something
-
a novel idea. You can still do that. But say you have
three days to get your paper in, you're going to go to the web, you're going to access
anything you can quickly access, you're not going to interlibrary loan
-
you don't have
time for it now
-
and you're probably going to take anything that is related to the topic
that you're working on. 

Your idea of what's relevant or useful to you changes
because of the context!

## Information Seeking & Searching: Models {.smaller}

- `Motivation`: [why users seek information, their information needs]{style="color: orange;"}
  - Dervin's Sense-Making
  - Belkin's Anomalous State of Knowledge

- `Situation`: [how users seek information]{style="color: orange;"}
  - Kuhlthau's Information Search Process

- `Resources`: [how users use resources/tools]{style="color: orange;"}
  - Mann's Library Research Models
  
- `Interaction`: [how users interact with information systems and the process(es) they use]{style="color: orange;"}


:::notes
We've also framed information seeking through four basic different
frameworks: *motivation, situation, resources, and interaction*.

For example,
*motivational models*
look at why users seek information. And
what are their information needs. And how does this make each information
seeking situation different? The two most prominent models in this area are
Dervin's
sense
-
making model and Belkin's anomalous state of knowledge
(ASK).

Dervin's
sense
-
making model is one that's primarily a constructivist point of
view, where, and
also
it's been referred to as kind of a 'Star Wars point of
view,' in that she says that as we move through the world in our daily lives and
we encounter different stimulus from different environments, we have a
cognitive shift where we learn something new about the
particular topic
or our
world around us.

And when we're seeking information, we then
have to
be
able to make sense of that information and fit it into our cognitive frameworks.
And once we can do that, then it becomes useful to us. But again, when is that
point? And what do we have to do to get there? Her model's a lot more
complex than that, and it's really a very interesting model to study. But again,
it's more of a constructivist point of view, where we learn from and construct
new realities for ourselves based upon the information we encounter in our
daily lives.

Belkin's anomalous state of knowledge, or the ASK model, is where we perceive
some 'gap' in our knowledge
-
base and we look for information, we use different
systems in order to fill that gap. It's a little bit more straightforward, but it's more of a
process model from, again, where we recognize we have a gap and everything we do
in the meantime is to find the information. Now, Belkin and
Dervin
have studied
various different
populations, primarily adults, and their models, again, reveal
different patterns and information to us about how users look for information, the
different kinds of sources they use, and how they interact with different systems.

*Situational models*
look at how users seek information. What do they
actually do
?
Kuhlthau's
model, one of the most
well known
situational models, has
*affective*
variables to it as well. Her research has primarily been with middle and high school
students.

We also have
*resource models*. Thomas Mann who was the Librarian of the Library of
Congress developed these models through watching people over the years and
interacting with different people.

We have also
*interaction models*
-
how users interact with information systems. For
example, "how we use a particular database, how we use the web, or what systems do
we actually use when we go to look for information."

It is important to remember that each of these different frameworks and models has
been developed through the years with different groups of users
-
from adults to
children to elderly, to what we call 'naive users' to more
experienced users, to web users, to database users, to OPAC users. 

We've put lots of
different labels on our user
-
groups, but we've developed these models on about forty
years of research now in
various different
aspects of our field.
:::

## Kuhlthau's ISP Model

`Task Initiation: Recognize Information Need`

1. [Topic Selection]{style="color: orange;"}: identify general topic
2. [Prefocus Formulation]{style="color: orange;"}: investigate information on general topic
3. [Focus Formulation]{style="color: orange;"}: decide on narrower topic 
4. [Information Collection]{style="color: orange;"}: gather information on narrower topic
5. [Search Closure]{style="color: orange;"}: complete the search
6. [Use of Information]{style="color: orange;"}: making use of information


:::notes
Kuhlthau's
model, for example, is probably the most well
-
known and the most
well
-
used in our field. She has kind of a somewhat linear approach, where we
have a topic selection at the beginning, where you identify a general
topic. Remember
most of her research was with middle
-
and high
-
school
students. The youth are looking for information for a research project or a
research paper. 

The first stage is topic selection. 

The second stage is called
'prefocus formulation' where the users do some investigation on the general
topic. They start looking at databases and encyclopedias. They start looking in
their card catalogs to find information in their libraries about that topic
-
or now
online.

The third stage is what
Kuhlthau
calls 'focus formulation,' where users decide
on a narrower topic from that general topic that they started from.
Kuhlthau
links users' affective states to each of these different stages
-
affective meaning
different emotional responses or feelings at the time of topic selection. At the
time of topic selection, they're a little anxious. And at the
prefocus
formulation
they're getting even a little bit more anxious because they're starting to look
for information, they
have to
identify resources, they
have to
use different
systems. And at the point of focus formulation users are starting to level off
again and feeling more comfortable.

Now, why that's important for us is because it tells us as reference librarians where we
should intervene, or what
Kuhlthau
calls the 'zone of intervention.' Should we let
users continue to look around for themselves for a while and then come and
questions? Or should we go and say, "Can I help you with this?"
Kuhlthau
says to
probably wait until between stages
two and three, somewhere during these stages is
what she calls the 'zone of intervention.' During the zone of intervention, that's when
you should jump in and say, "Maybe I can help you with this different system," or
"This resource might be better for you."

Step four is where users collect the information.
They've decided on a narrower topic,
they've explored some different systems, some different resources, and they start
gathering some information on that narrower topic.

Step five is the search closure where users complete their search, and finally, the last
step that
Kuhlthaus
has recently added, when users
use
the information.

Now, this model appears to be linear, but at any point, you can go back through the
stages. If you get to stage two and you don't like this general topic, so you might
propose a whole completely new topic and start over again. 

Or you might get to three
and you're not quite happy with that narrow topic, so you go back and explore the
general topic some more. 

So, again, it's not necessarily a linear process. But what
she's primarily famous for, and especially in this model, is this whole process, but also
the affective states of the individual and when we should
actually intervene.
:::

## Mann's Library Research Models {.smaller}

`These are models for library searching, or how people (end-users and/or professionals) use resources and tools to find information`

- Search options based on organization of information in libraries
- Importance of models in concealing/revealing search options/indexing system
- Applicability of models in any subject area, language, format

:::notes
Mann has developed some
really interesting
models. He's looked at different
search options that we've developed based on how we organize information.
Also, his models show the importance of our library systems in revealing or
concealing different pieces of information to our users. How much can they
tell
about our resources by looking at a bibliographic record? How useful is
that? Do they
actually use
our pathfinders and our finding aids?

He's also developed some different models, like for example, a specific subject
or discipline model. Mann has looked longitudinally at how different
disciplines look for information. For example, Social scientists do what's
called 'citation checking or chasing' where you find a
really good
article and
then you go and look at the citations in the back and then you start chasing
those down. People in the hard sciences, like say chemistry and physics, they
call their colleagues before they do any research in our systems. They'll
actually network
before they'll use a library database or to your library
catalog.

So, through the years Mann developed these different models from observing
and working with people in reference situations.

The traditional library science model is one model that Mann examined how people use different tools we've developed such as our classification schemes, or
controlled vocabulary or subject headings within library catalogs, but also how people
use bibliographies and indexes.
:::

## Research Models

`Examples: [Mann's Library Research Models`](https://archive.org/details/libraryresearchm00mann) (just a few, there are many others!)

- Specific Subject or Discipline Model
- Traditional Library Science Model
  - Classification, controlled-vocabulary catalog, published bibliographies and indexes
- Actual-Practice Model
- Principle of Least Effort

:::notes
Mann's Actual practice model is a generic model of "What do people really do
when they look for information in, say, the Library of Congress?" Do they ask
reference librarians first? Do they go to the OPAC first; do they go to a finding
aid? So, he's examining a user's process rather than lumping them into a
group like we saw in some of the earlier models.


The last one isn't Mann's model. We attribute it to
Zipf. It's the 'principle of
least effort,' but Mann has developed this model further. This is the idea that
people will go to the least amount of effort to find what they need. How many
of us are guilty of that? At some point or another we all just want the
information right now, right quick, and the web makes it even easier for us to
do this. We can also apply this model to the Web. It's very interesting in early
retrieval research, we knew that people would probably access the first fifty
hits when they searched our OPACs, and believe it or not, that still carries into
the web. Most people don't go beyond the first fifty hits when they find results
on the search page.

So, these again are just some ideas of the different models we've developed
through the years.

## How Do Questions Relate to Information Objects?

- Information Object Attributes *(general characteristics, eg has a creator, size, content)*

- Implications for practice: understanding users' information needs will help us create better representations for objects *(more efficient access)*

:::notes
So, you might ask, "How do these questions relate to information objects?"
and "Why is it important that we understand users when we're organizing
information?

If you ever
take a look
at search logs which capture all the
searches and terms that users input into a system to do a search, it's really
revealing about the types of words they use or the types of attributes or fields
they use when they're looking for
particular objects
in the collection. 

And
so
from that type of study, we can attempt to understand what the users'
information needs are as well as how they
actually search
for information in
your system.


The implications of understanding users' information needs really
help us create better representations for objects and provide more efficient
access. 

So, knowing more about how our users interact with systems, the types
of problems or information needs they bring to a system, and then the
processes they undertake to find those needs is
really important
when you're
designing a system or when you're cataloging or creating representation for
the resources in a collection. 

We'll explore this further.
:::

## Examples

- User Question (1): *I want all the books by Janet Evanovich*
  
- Attributes
  - Format
  - Creator
  
- User Question (2): *I need to find current books or videos on new paint treatments for kitchens*

- Attributes
  - ????

:::notes
Let's take some examples of this.

Our user question might be, "I want all the books by Janet Evanovich." When
you look at that question, what are the attributes that you see embedded within
the words the user inputs into the system or they ask the reference librarian?
We have 'format' because they want
books
and we have 'creator' because
we're looking for books by a particular author.

Another example would be in user question two: "I need to find current books
or videos on new paint treatments for kitchens." Now, attributes associated
with this
particular question
might be 'date,' because they're asking for current
books, 'format' books or videos,
and also
'subject' because they're interested
in a particular subject area of new paint treatments that they might use in
kitchens.

So, you can see just from examining some basic questions that might come to
your library or your information organization, you can begin to get an idea of
the needs of your users. And, of course, this has many different implications
for practice related to the information organization, but also related to, say,
collection development and other aspects of services we provide.
:::

## User Expectations

- Expectations for Retrieval Performance (eg. `precision and recall`)

- Other Measures: `Relevance or Pertinence`

:::notes
Another area that we look at when we think about user expectations for our
systems or for the representations that we create of the objects in our collection
are the concepts of retrieval, or
*precision
and
recall*.

Recall assesses the output of the system, meaning that every object that is
related to that query in some way should be
returned back
to a user in the list
of hits in the system. It also assesses the ability of the system to retrieve all
relevant items, meaning that everything that is retrieved in the set should be
related to the subject or the attributes in the user's question. So, if they're
looking for all books on paint treatments that you might have in your
collection, they should return all records related to paint treatments. If not, it's
said to be 'low recall.

Precision, on the other hand, assesses relevance of output, meaning it assesses
the ability of the system to retrieve
only
the relevant items. So, precision is
looking at how specifically the system has returned
only
items that are
appropriate to your query. As you can see, this could be a problem, especially
if the system is difficult to use or the representations don't match the terms
being used by the user themselves. And as we'll talk about in Module 4, there
are very different types of systems and they operate in different ways, and that
could impact both recall and precision.

So, again, when we look at our users' queries, we can tell
whether or not
they
want a very precise return, and
only
the
particular objects, such as
only
books
by Janet Evanovich or current books by a particular author, and if they retrieve
items that are not books or
they retrieve
items not by that author, it's said that
precision is very low. It's also important to understand that our systems have
an inverse relationship between precision and recall, in that precision if it's
high, means that recall is generally
pretty low.

We'll talk more about this when in Module 4, but I
wanted to address it just briefly here. Other measures that you might see in the
literature related to retrieval are 'relevance' or 'pertinence'
-
or how useful that
information or that object is to the user.

## What Do We Know About How People Organize Their Stuff?

- Not Very Much!!

- Personal Information Management
  - In home spaces
  - In professional spaces
  - In digital spaces
  
- In socially-constructed spaces
  - Online, Web 2.0 environments like Flickr, LibraryThing
  
:::notes
Another
really interesting
area that's new to our field, but that also helps us to
better understand our users is what's called 'personal information
management' (PIM). We'll talk more about this later in the semester in Module
8. But PIM this is the research into how people organize their stuff.

At this point we don't really know very much about how people organize the
'stuff' in their lives
-
whether it's personal, whether it's, your kitchen spice
cabinet, or whether it's the list that you make to help organize your day; or it's
the digital stuff on your computer or your various devices, but we are learning
more. 

In the areas of environmental design and in human
- computer interaction, personal information management has been researched for quite a
few years. I have given you a couple of readings related to this because this is
an area that I find particularly fascinating, but I also think it tells us a lot about
our users in general.
So, Abbas' Chapter 5 
will talk a lot more about this, and again, we'll come back to it in Module 8,
but it's
a really interesting
area of our field. We've looked at different types of
information management in our home spaces, in professional spaces,
and also
now in digital spaces.

Also, another area that we learn about how people organize their information
on their webpages or their pictures or their videos is in the socially constructed
spaces that are online in Web 2.0 environments, like LibraryThing and flickr.

There is quite a large body of research in this area now beginning back with image
researchers at least fifteen years ago. You can read about this interesting information
behavior in Abbas Chapter 5. Each of these readings will help you begin to think
about what we can really know about how people organize their stuff and how that
will then help us to design better systems and create representations that are relevant,
or more user
-
centered.

## Implications for Practice {.smaller}

`Models of Information Seeking....`

- Guide development of user-centered services
  - Reference
  - Searching
  - Indexing/Cataloging
  - IR Systems Design
  
- Librarians improve organization of resources to accommodate users' searching styles
- Understand users'   
  - Decision-making criteria
  - Process strategies
  - Expectations of search process
  - Attitudes and feelings
  - Organization schemes (categories, labels, methods)
  
:::notes

Why is understanding the many complexities of users important to what we're
talking about in this class? Why am I boring you with all this stuff?

First, understanding our users and their information behaviors and organizing
behaviors guide development of user
-
centered services, not just in reference
departments, not when we search, help our users search, but also in indexing
and cataloging. 

The models we have
developed
and the research conducted
into user behaviors help us understand more about the kinds of searches people
do. What fields do they use in our databases? Do they
only
conduct author
-
title, which are called known
-
item searches, or do they do more subject
searching? 

So, when we're building a system, we're designing a system that
we hope will be useful. When we're creating representations, such as card
catalog records, knowing about how people go about looking for information
can help us design better systems. We'll know which fields need to be
searchable; we'll know which attributes or aspects of our objects should be
represented in our records.

So, again, knowing a little bit more about how our users look for, and find
information, and use information, can help us design systems that are more in
line with their information needs. This understanding also can help us choose in terms when indexing and cataloging and to know more about what level of
terminology we need to use when representing the subject content.

Furthermore, as a searcher, understanding the levels of exhaustively and specificity
that are present in the indexing or the cataloging in the system can help you become a
better searcher. Your search terms will be more aligned with the actual vocabulary
used by the cataloger or indexer within the system. So, therefore, you should have
better retrieval. You can also help your users understand this and make them more
efficient in their searching as well.
:::
  
## Implications for Practice (Cont.) {.smaller}

- Help us
  - `Choose elements for system design`
    - Fields to include in system
    - Fields to make searchable (indexed)
    - Creation of input rules
  - `Choose appropriate controlled or other vocabulary to use (natural language, free text)`
  - `Choose appropriate level of indexing`
    - Exhaustivity
    - Specificity
    - Number of subject terms to include
  
:::notes
Other implications for practice that I did start to mention on the previous slide
are that understanding our users really helps us to design a particular system
for users. In libraries we tend to be very generic in that our systems are for a
very large, diverse audience of individuals. 

So, sometimes it's not possible to
build a system that's going to satisfy every user. In fact, it's
really not
possible
to do so, unless you have a very specialized collection, a very specialized user
-
group and you understand very closely those users and their information
behaviors.

But learning about our users helps us to choose elements that we want to
include or that we know need to be included in our system design. It helps us
make decisions and to work with our vendors to determine what fields to
include
and also
which fields should be indexed or searchable within your
system. It also helps us to create input rules. 

So, for those of you who are
going to work on the organization system project, there is a section in the
project where you
have the opportunity to
create input rules for each of the
fields within your system. This is analogous to the standards we use when we
create catalog records in library catalogs. We use the Resource Description and
Access (RDA) and other subject heading lists in order to create records in our
system, and those standards are sets of rules that guide catalogers.

Also, we use what we know about users to choose appropriate controlled vocabulary
or other types of vocabulary to represent subjects in our systems. In libraries we tend
to use Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) or Sears subject headings if
we're in a school library. We might use a user
-
specific ontology if we're in a business
community, where we've designed a specific ontology to represent the language of
that community. So, again, knowing about our users and the types of searches or
searches they do conduct really can help us in these choices.

Also, it helps us choose the appropriate level of indexing in our catalogs. How many
subject terms do we need? How many fields do we need? And there are two measures
that we talk about in libraries called 'exhaustivity' and 'specificity' that really define
the number of subject terms or the level of exhaustiveness
-
how many terms do we
use to describe the content of an object for effective retrieval? How specific should
those terms be? Is it appropriate to have very specific terms in the catalog or an
academic library versus when we're creating records for children, where we'll want to
have more broad generalized terms?

So, again, learning more about our users and the
types of searching systems they use really can help us determine
all of
these different
factors.

:::notes

Christine
Borgman
in her 1996 article, "Why are online catalogs
still
hard to
use?" explained why OPACs in libraries are difficult to use. Her article is a
really good
one for giving you even more conceptual framework for what
we've addressed in this lecture. 

System design models in the past were based
upon the original card catalog model and what could fit on the library catalog
card. And unfortunately, a lot of systems today are still based on that model.
We can fit on information about the author, the title, and maybe one to three
subject headings, and a classification code.

So, that's how our basic library
systems were designed. In our next generation catalogs we have improved the
interface design, added more searching functionality, and
allow
users to search
using a "Google
-
like" search box.
BUT,
and this is what is
really important,
their retrieval is still based on the RECORDS or representations of items in the
collection that catalogers have developed.
:::
  
## IR System Design (Cont.) 

`Traditionally IR System Design Often...`

- Based on `assumptions about information-seeking` rather than research (although that is changing!)
- `Directed toward system use by information professionals`, not end-users
- `Forces system users to adapt to the system`, rather than adapts to users' natural abilities

:::notes
In our field and as new technologies are developed and as users start to use
different systems and start to use them in different ways, it also forces us to
rethink decisions and choices we've made in the past. Again, that's why I think
it's such an exciting time to be in our field right now because we are really at
the forefront of a lot of these change.

Also, we've been designing and working through our records structures, we've
been designing XML systems that can work XML MARC, which gives us
even more functionality than the traditional MARC system might have. And
people are designing more user
-
centered systems when they create digital
libraries; we're not just using MARC record structures, we're designing
metadata schemes like Dublin Core.

What is in our library catalog records may
not have changed much until the recent 5 years with the development of the
FRBR model and with the new cataloging
standard, RDA. AND when we move beyond the MARC record in library
catalogs into BIBFRAME, our records will hopefully connect to other external
records through this linked data structure. But that is for another module.
:::
  
## IR System Design (Cont.) 

`Good IR System Design Tends To Be...`

- Based on study of users needs/interactions
- Interactive to accommodate natural information-seeking behaviors
- Flexible to accommodate differences among individual users

:::notes
In conclusion, good information retrieval system design should be based on a
study of our users, user needs, and their interactions with different systems.

We need to understand the types of searches that they bring to a system. We
need to understand the attributes in those searches that should be fields in our
system. We also need to understand the exhaustivity and specificity level of
the terms that we use to represent subjects or other concepts within our
systems.
And also,
whether or not
we need to have very complex concepts
represented. Or can the terms be very general in nature?

Our systems also
have to
be very interactive to accommodate natural
information seeking behaviors. We need to think about how users really do
interact with systems at different levels - at their homes, in their work
environments -
to try to make sure our systems can try to emulate some of those
natural behaviors.

Systems also need to be flexible to accommodate differences among different
users because no two users are going to interact with the system in the same
way. They're not going to use the same terminology. They're probably not
going to use the same functions in your system - whether it's a simple search or an advanced search. So, you're going to need to keep that in mind as well.
