<h1>Introduction</h1>
<aside class="notes">
<p>In Module 7.1.1 we are going to begin talking about the conceptual models, FRBR, FRAD, and FRSAD that underlie the new cataloging standard, RDA, but also will be incorporated into the new bibliographic framework once it is ready to replace the MARC record structure.</p>
<p>There are three lectures in this topic (7.1.1 Part 1, 7.1.1 Part 2, and 7.1.2). So, let’s begin with an overview of what we’re going to cover and how these conceptual models will lead into our discussion for RDA.</p>

<p>We will ‘take a look under the hood’ and explore some systems that have been FRBRized or have included those FRBR elements within the system, and how they relate to libraries and library cataloging. We’ll talk about the FRBR conceptual model and user tasks.

<aside class="notes">
<p>FRBR, or as you’ve probably read in your readings already, stands for the Functional Requirements of Bibliographic Records. FRBR was a study began by IFLA, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. The study itself was designed to explore how users actually use library catalogs and their expectations for doing so. It was a groundbreaking study, it was published in 1998. And yes, I know, that is a very long time ago now, but we are just starting to see how FRBR can be implemented within different systems.</p>
<p>It was published in 1998, but the real work of FRBR did not begin until we started revising the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, which began sometime in 2003. During the process of revising AACR2, it came to the awareness of everyone on the various committees that we were taking, again, a Band-Aid approach to the standard, where we were trying, again, to shoehorn AACR2 into use with the new types of formats of the digital environment, and we were not doing so successfully. We also became aware that we really needed to re-conceptualize the whole idea of cataloging and cataloging in the cataloging standard based upon the FRBR conceptual model.</p>
<p>Your readings for this chapter are going to give you quite a bit of history of FRBR and why it became necessary, and then, hopefully, you can make the link between the FRBR elements in its conceptual model as well as the user tasks that the FRBR report enumerates.</p>
<p>So, FRBR itself, as I mentioned before, is a conceptual model. It’s not a database model. It’s not an implementation model. It is a conceptual model, and it’s not a set of cataloging rules. It’s not a data format, and it’s not specific to any type of system design.</p>
<p>So, it’s important to keep that in mind. It’s a conceptual model that enumerates user tasks so that we know our users’ expectations and what they want to do when they come to our library catalog. What that tells use as catalogers and indexers as well as system designers is that we have to align those user tasks with the metadata structure within our records, with the metadata itself that we are using to describe the objects in collections.</p>
<p>The FRBR report not only enumerates the user tasks for us and explains them in more depth, it also develops an entity-relationship model, so you can see how this could play out in a database environment. But also, it brings to light some of the relationships between the entities that we’re not currently taking advantage of in our information retrieval systems. It maps the user tasks to the entity attributes and relationships, and it enumerates basic requirements that should be part of our bibliographic records.</p>
<p>I really hope you do take some time to look at the FRBR report in more depth. We’re not going to cover all of it, but we will look quite a bit at these conceptual models throughout the semester. We will also look at how they fit within the MARC record structure, which is what we have in place to date.</p>

<h2>FRBR: User Tasks</h2>
<p><em>FRBR report, pp.&nbsp;8–9</em></p>
<ul>
<li>using the data to <code>find</code> materials that correspond to the user’s stated search criteria (e.g., in the context of a search for all documents on a given subject, or a search for a recording issued under a particular title)</li>
<li>using the data retrieved to <code>identify</code> an entity (e.g., to confirm that the document described in a record corresponds to the document sought by the user, or to distinguish between two texts or recordings that have the same title)</li>
<li>using the data to <code>select</code> an entity that is appropriate to the user’s needs (e.g., to select a text in a language the user understands, or to choose a version of a computer program that is compatible with the hardware and operating system available to the user) using the data in order to <code>acquire or obtain access</code> to the entity described (e.g., to place a purchase order for a publication, to submit a request for the loan of a copy of a book in a library’s collection, or to access online an electronic document stored on a remote computer)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Let’s begin by looking at the user tasks that the FRBR study uncovered. Now, you can also think of these in terms of Cutter’s Object of the Catalog, because there’s definitely some overlap.</p>
<p>The first task is that our records should be, or the metadata in our records, should be used to find materials that correspond to the user’s stated search criteria. For example, in the context of a search for all documents on a given subject or a search for a recording issued under a particular title, we should be able to find materials that match that search criteria. Now, we’ve conducted many studies through the years that have looked at how people actually use our library catalogs and what fields they use and the types of searches they conduct within our catalogs. So, we do know that there are specific criteria that people like to search for. We do know that there are what are called ‘known item searches’, meaning that the user knows something about the item they’re searching for; usually, it’s the title or the author, and also, they may know a subject, but the subject may be either too broad or too specific for that type of search.</p>
<p>The second user task is using the data retrieved to identify an entity, in other words to confirm that the document presented in a record corresponds to the document sought by the user or to distinguish between two texts or recordings that have the same title. So, there should be metadata in your records to support the identification function, meaning that if I want a particular edition of a work, I should have that information in the record to enable identification.</p>
<p>The third user task is to Select. The user should be able to use the data in a record to select an entity that is appropriate to the user’s needs. For example, I need to select text in a language that I can actually understand and read, or if it’s an audio work, that I can listen to and I have the language ability to understand the work itself, or to choose a version of a computer program that’s compatible with the hardware and operating system that’s available to me. So, if I only work with a PC, I want to know that the software package will actually work on my computer. So, the metadata needs to be present in the record that gives me this selection opportunity.</p>
<p>The fourth user task is to use the data in order to acquire or to obtain access to the entity described. So, for example, if I find something that I want to check out in the library, I need to have information that tells me where to find that object and acquire it within the library. So, I need to know a classification number, for example, or I need to know where it is within the library’s collection–if it’s on the third floor. Or if it’s an online document, I need to have an access point so that I know how I can access that information object.</p>
<p>The FRBR user tasks, as you are probably thinking at this point, are not that different than Cutter’s Objects for the Catalog. His are just a little bit more specific to the types of metadata that were created in records at that point and continue to be included in records today. However, the last function–the acquire function–is something that is new to the FRBR findings even though to us it seems common sense.</p>

<h2>FRBR: Entity-Relationship Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>Entities are divided into <code>three groups</code> in the FRBR model:
<ul>
<li><code>Group 1</code>, which contains entities that are “products of intellectual or artistic endeavor”</li>
<li><code>Group 2</code>, which contains entities that are potential creators, producers, or owners of Group 1 entities</li>
<li><code>Group 3</code>, which could be called “other,” and contains entities that fall into the categories or concept, place, object, or event—entities that could be the subject of Group 1 entities but that are not considered to be either Group 1 or Group 2 entities</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Another value of the FRBR report was the conceptual model itself and the entity-relationship model that it lays out for us. This model allows us to think beyond the 1:1 relationship that we have present in library catalogs today. Think back about the history of library catalogs as we discuss this conceptual model.</p>
<p>Library catalogs in the beginning were basically a list and a location device. The catalog would tell you the name or the title or the author of the object and where to find it in the library. When we moved to the card catalog environment, this environment allowed us to add additional metadata that the list format did not and it allowed us to update our records a bit easier. However, it was still a very flat file-based system. You had one object, one record. You might have had multiple cards or access points within your catalog that allowed you to find it by author, title, and subject or series title or other authors’ information. But again, it was still basically one record describing one object in a catalog without linking it to other works by that same individual or some of these other relationships we’re going to look at in the FRBR conceptual model.</p>
<p>When we moved into the automated MARC environment, we started in a flat file system in a homegrown database created by the Library of Congress. And not until the nineties did we really move beyond that system into a proprietary database system that allowed some of these relationships to be built into our records. And then we also have to rely on our integrated library systems to create those functions and provide that functionality to our users.</p>
<p>The newer clustering systems, or some of the next generation catalogs, where they work on tag clouds searching and some of those additional functionalities, are moving in this direction; however, there are very few ILS databases to date that have actually implemented FRBR, but we will look at a couple of systems at the end of this lecture.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s look at the FRBR entity relationship model and how it established first, entities for us to think about as we describe or represent objects in our collections, but then it also builds in those relationships that are present and have always been present but are not in place or are not functional within current systems.</p>
<p>The entities with the FRBR entity relationship model are divided into three groups. There’s Group 1, which contains entities that are products of intellectual or artistic endeavors ; Group 2, which are entities that are potential creators, producers, or owners of Group 1 entities; and Group 3, which are still being called the “other” and contain entities that fall into the categories of concept, place, object, and event. These are entities that could be the subject of Group 1 entities but that are also not considered in either Group 1 or Group 2 entities. Group 3 has not been fully developed within the RDA structure; I just want to tell you that right now. And the last conversation that standards developers have been having about Group 3 is that it may not be developed within RDA. RDA at this point is for bibliographic description or descriptive elements or cataloging, where Group 3 would move it into the subject cataloging realm.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, let’s take a look at these different entities and relationships.</p>

<h2>GROUP 1</h2>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-2108098842.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch" width="552"><aside class="notes">
<p>On this slide we see what’s called the ‘WEMI model’, the work, expression, manifestation, and item of the Group 1 entities. We also see the relationships. The relationships inherent among the Group 1 entities are shown here, such as work is expressed through an expression–that’s a relationship. An expression is embodied in an actual manifestation of an item –that’s another relationship. A manifestation is then exemplified by an item–that, again, is yet another relationship. These entities and this set of relationships are all present when we hold an item in our hand.</p>
<p>Like we have a copy of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, which is an item. It’s one copy of a manifestation–this book,– and that embodies, captures, and records an expression in the English language of a work called Hamlet that was created by Shakespeare. This is a bibliographic resource and it embodies the English language expression of the work, Hamlet.</p>
<p>Now, if I have another item in my hand that’s a DVD, yet a manifestation of one version or movie version of Hamlet, a work–remember Hamlet is the main work,–we’ve got two different items and they are different manifestations of the work of Hamlet expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the attributes of identifying elements for these different entities. I also want to mention here that I’m using some of the slides from Barbara Tillet’s wonderful webinar and some of the pre-conference presentation that she did at ALA a few years ago.</p>
<p>But what’s important in this particular slide is that we see this model, WEMI, in place. Work is realized through the expression. Work is the idea that someone comes up with. It’s the story that you have in your mind that you then express in some way by writing it out or recording it. That is embodied in what is considered a manifestation of that work. It could be the published work itself.</p>
<p>And then the item that you have in your library or on your library shelf is the manifestation of that work itself. You can see also there are different relationships in play here. There is a recursive relationship, meaning that the item is expressing the work, and the work is eventually expressed as an item. There are 1:1 relationships, but there are also one to many relationships. Okay, let’s take a look at a different way of approaching this model.</p>

<p>‘Work’ according to FRBR is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, it’s the idea that someone comes up with. It’s an abstract entity. And I like to think of it as the ideas that a person has in their head.</p>
<p>A work is realized through one or more expressions in the form of some notation, like alphanumeric notation, musical notation, choreographic notation, or it can be sound, an image, an object, movement, etc. Or any combination of these things.</p>
<p>An ‘expression’ can be a performance or a translation or a version of a particular work. It’s useful to identify works and expressions because we can use the names of works and expressions as a device to organize displays of information, and I’ll show you more about this in a minute.</p>
<p>Alexandre Dumas, the individual you see here, was the creator of the work The Three Musketeers. All of these aspects are related, and by making those relationships known within our systems, within our records, we can show our users pathways to get to the information they need. So, our users can find Alexandre Dumas, they can find the work The Three Musketeers, but if we build in these additional relationships, we can also link to other works by Dumas, but we can also link to derivations of the work, The Three Musketeers.</p>

<p>Manifestations can come in many types of packages. They can be books, they can be CDs, they can be DVDs, videocassettes, and so on. These are the containers or carriers of the content that they hold. So, these are all different versions of the work, The Three Musketeers by Alex[sic] Dumas. But they are manifestations or physical representations of that work.</p>

<p>Once we capture a particular expression of a work in some container or we record that content on some carrier, we have a manifestation of a particular expression of a work.</p>
<p>When we record the intellectual or artistic content, we move from the abstract “work/expression” to some physical entity. As FRBR puts it, a manifestation is the physical embodiment of an expression of a work. In order to record something you have to put it on or in some container or carrier. So, manifestations appear in various “carriers,” such as books, periodicals, maps, sound recordings, films, CD-ROMs, DVDs, multimedia games, Web pages, and so on.</p>
<p>A manifestation represents all the physical objects that have the same characteristics of intellectual content and physical form. In actuality, a manifestation is itself an abstract entity, but describes and represents physical entities, that is all the items that have the same content and carrier. When we create a bibliographic record, it typically represents a manifestation – that is, it can serve to represent any copy of that manifestation held in any library anywhere.</p>
<p>One example or copy of a manifestation is called an item. Usually it is a single object, but sometimes it consists of more than one physical object, e.g., a book issued in 2 separately bound volumes – the 2 volumes represent 1 item; or a sound recording on 3 separate CD’s. With an item entity, we are able to identify an individual copy of a manifestation and to describe its unique characteristics - that may be information relevant for circulation - checking a particular copy out to borrow it from the library or for tracking its preservation.</p>

<h2>Elements to Describe Resources</h2>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-1611618249.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch" width="563"><aside class="notes">
<p>There are essential characteristics or elements that we associate with each of the entities in FRBR. FRBR calls them attributes. RDA calls them elements.</p>
<p>For a work, the main elements are its title, a date it was created if we know it, possibly its identifier (if it has one, e.g., for rights management), etc. For an expression – which remember can be things like a translation or version or a performance – we have characteristics like the type of content – what form it took: like text, sound, image, and so on, or its language or information about a performance – on what date did it happen and so on.</p>
<p>Once we record a performance, or publish a translation, or package that content in any way, we produce a manifestation – an entity that is of interest to a library – something for which we would provide a bibliographic description. And a manifestation often brings some information about itself in the form of a title page or a main screen or a label that includes the characteristics of that manifestation – like who published it, where, and on what date, what are its dimensions and extent.</p>
<p>Then for an item, when we have one particular copy of a manifestation, we have other elements or information that characterizes or identifies that particular item, like its physical location when we shelve it – a call number, information about its owner, or perhaps some information about the color and type of binding on that special copy or a barcode– information we can use for inventory control, so we can know where our materials are – so we can make them available for our users.</p>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-3606563586.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch" width="476"><aside class="notes">
<p>In FRBR we saw major advantages in declaring persons, families, and corporate bodies as separate entities that would be related to other entities.</p>
<p>We have traditionally thought of controlling the names for persons and corporate bodies through authority records. By declaring persons, families, and corporate bodies as entities we have much more flexibility in the controlled naming and we can eliminate redundancies that would occur if we made them elements to just describe an entity.</p>
<p>In an application of FRBR using the MARC format, as most of our library systems do today, we could make a single authority record for a person or corporate body and link it to other authority records or to bibliographic records or holdings records as needed, depending on the relationship we wished to identify.</p>
<p>Within the authority record or package of information about a person, we would include all the variant forms of name used by that person and all the various ways the names can be presented – different forms of the name, different spellings in different languages in different scripts – bringing all the variant forms together as the characteristics of that entity to help identify it.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Okay, let’s step back here for just a minute because we’ve been talking about these different groups of entities, but we’ve also mentioned FRAD and we’ve also started talking a little bit about FRSAD, so I want to interject those here.</p>
<p>FRAD is another IFLA study that was looking at the Functional Requirements for Authority Data. So, instead of looking at the requirements that users need in records, in bibliographic records, FRAD was examining the functional requirements that should be included in our authority records or any type of authority data system.</p>
<p>It was, again, an IFLA group called the Division of Bibliographic Control. They worked between 1999 and 2009. So, their report is definitely more current than the FRBR report. In December 2008, they came out with a final text that was approved in March 2009. And you can see that they worked with the elements that we see in the Group 2 entities and those different relationships.</p>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>The Functional Requirements for Authority Data also have identified user tasks. And a few of these overlap with what we see in FRBR. These user tasks are find, such as find an entity or a set of entities corresponding to a stated criteria from the user; identify, being able to identify a specific entity that it meets the criteria that you specifically need for an item.</p>
<p>We have also added as part of the Functional Requirements for Authority Data clarify and contextualize. Clarify means to justify, or to document the authority record creator’s reason for choosing the name or the form of the name on which an access point is based.</p>
<p>Now, what this means is that within the authority record, the person who creates that record is supposed to explain why they chose that form of name or chose that individual name as being the form we use as an access point. The fourth user task is to contextualize, or to understand.</p>
<p>So, within our authority data, we need to be able to place a person, corporate body, work, etc. in context with the other works, with other individuals. And I’ve given you an example here that you can go take a look at later. But there’s a system called WorldCat Identities that will allow you to look at some FRAD authority records so you can see some of the different relationships and attributes represented in these records.</p>

<p>FRAD also identifies some attributes, and those that are in green are what we would call the ‘required’ or ‘core’ attributes. These are attributes of a person or a corporate body. So, for example, our authority data should include the title of the person, dates associated with the person (meaning death date and the period of activity if known), their gender, place of birth, place of death, country, place of residence. Those are those core or required attributes.</p>
<p>Then we might also add to this affiliation, address, language of person, field of activity, profession and occupation, biography, history, other informational elements that are associated with that person.</p>
<p>Now, again, we’ll look at this later in topic 6, but I want you to think about what you see in green here. Those are elements that we already include in our authority data, but the ones in black are definitely new attributes that are not in authority records.

<h2>Group 3 Entities (FRSAD)</h2>

<img data-src="images/clipboard-792265143.png" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center r-stretch" style="width:80.0%"><aside class="notes">
<p>Okay, now let’s look at those Group 3 entities. And these are what are coming from FRSAD. And FRSAD was published in 2011. These are the Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data. So, FRSAD is part of FRAD, and it was within the same working group, but also different individuals. Glen Patton, which you have as one of the authors of your readings, gives you a more detailed history of both FRAD and FRSAD.</p>
<p>But FRSAD are those entities related specifically to subjects. Remember that subjects can be also Group 1 or Group 2 entities, intellectual endeavor, and the elements that are included here are concepts, objects, events, and places. These are all in blue because they are new to the idea of authority work. Before we would have concepts represented in subject records, but not necessarily objects as subjects or events or places; however, these are what we see in our Group 3 entities as part of our FRSAD model. Also keep in mind that persons can be subjects.</p>
<p>These are part of that Group 1 and Group 2 entities; they can also be the subject of works, and here are some examples. So, a biography about an individual, such as a criticism of the music of a particular composer–like Bach,–those are some examples of when an individual is the subject of a work. You can probably come up with some other ideas.</p>
<p>Concepts, objects, events, and places also have their own attributes and identifying characteristics as identified in FRSAD and will in the future be shown in RDA, at least that’s the hope. The target date was 2012, but FRSAD is just still in working group, and they’ve issued a report, which you have a link to on your readings page.</p>
<p>But these have not been written into RDA as it’s currently published. So, again, some of those identifying characteristics of events include things like location, date, and perhaps relationships to organizing bodies for that event. They also identify characteristics of places, which might include GPS coordinates, variant names of the place, etc. These attributes and relationships are all new ways of thinking about and representing subjects within our bibliographic records, but they’re also data that will be captured in our subject authority records.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the subject relationships within those Group 3 entities.</p>
<p>So, for example, we’re used to the idea that a work is created by a person and that a person creates a work, but we also have to think about the fact that a work has a subject, which would be its concept or its topic, and now we can think about location and event as well.</p>
<p>And that concept, topic, location, event can be the subject of a work.</p>

<p>A work can be about many things, so this subject relationship, as shown on this slide, relates a work to all of the other entities –because a work can be about another bibliographic resource, like a documentary movie about the Gutenberg Bible or a work can be about a person – like a biography – or about a corporate body – like the history of an organization. But a work can also be about a concept, or about some object, or event, about a place. We may also at some point add the entity for time to this model (which is under consideration by the FRSAR Wkg. Grp).</p>
<p>So those are the entities and relationships in the FRBR entity-relationship model, and some of the elements or attributes that characterize each of those entities. We’ve covered what FRBR is in terms of its conceptual model, let’s now move on to why we need it. I’ve already mentioned some reasons: like it reminds us of the importance of being able to group related things together and it gives us a clear way of identifying those things and describing them with specific elements that can then be re-used or packaged to best suit the needs for displaying information to users.</p>
