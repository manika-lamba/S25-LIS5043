::: notes
Welcome to Module 1! In this week, you will learn about data's role in
making decisions. You have of course all heard “BIG DATA” and perhaps
even more about its potentials in business, government, security, and
other contexts.

Libraries and information organizations have been dealing with BIG DATA
(and small data) for many years, but as more is produced each year, it
has also become the focus of many library and data science efforts.

The world is virtually drowning in data, in many forms, produced through
research, scholarship, governance, business, etc. Managing and curating
the data is essential for its use or re-use. Libraries and information
organizations are also using data visualization tools to analyze data as
well as for outreach and public relationship purposes.

In this module we will briefly explore data stewardship and
visualization and the role that information professionals play in
today’s data saturated world. We will also briefly look at data
visualization as a means to help others make sense of their data.
:::

## What is Data Stewardship? {.smaller}

-   `Data Stewardship` is concerned with all aspects of the **creation,
    management, analysis, and communication of data** focusing
    particularly on the application of
    `computational methods to digital data`

-   Data Stewardship = Data Management + Data Curation + Data Analytics

    -   Data management: Ensuring the management of data in order to
        better support the analysis of data
    -   Data curation: Ensuring that data can be efficiently and
        reliably found and used
    -   Data analytics: Employing specific techniques to extract
        knowledge from data

-   It includes among other things: *acquisition and collection,
    modeling, workflow, provenance, validity and integrity, metadata,
    preservation, integration, retrieval, re- use, policy, standards,
    identifiers, format conversions, processing levels, supporting
    reproducibility*, etc.

-   It includes active and on-going management of data through its
    lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and
    education; curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval,
    maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time.

## Science of... vs Practice of...

The [*science*]{.underline} of data stewardship:

```         
research and development on new methods of data management and use;
draws on mathematical and engineering methods, but also on methods from social science, law, economics, and other disciplines
```

The [*practice*]{.underline} of data stewardship:

```         
use and adaptation of data management methods to meet user needs and support data analytics
```

## Values

*`Data analytics values:`* Extraction should be novel, fast, precise,
accurate

*`Data stewardship values:`* Data should be efficient and reliable:
**findable, useable, legal** *(thereby supporting novelty, speed,
precision, accuracy)*

## Importance of Data Stewardship {.smaller}

-   Where real world interdisciplinary challenges are concerned,
    managerial & curatorial problems are acute:

> *Large amounts of rapidly changing data, often heterogeneous in nature
> and developed by different scientific communities, must be found,
> retrieved, authenticated, reformatted, integrated with other data and
> managed for effective use, and demonstrably reliable even after
> processing and preparation*

-   Supporting analysis, discovery, and use is an enormous challenge

> . . . it involves the complex management of large-scale data storage
> and preservation, creation of metadata and tools for retrieval and
> context documentation, preparation of computationally accessible
> documentation of provenance and workflow, conducting reliable format
> conversions to support new tools and applications, the management of
> identifiers and validity checks that accommodate format changes, the
> integration of related data elements from substantially different data
> sources, and more. . . .

## Importance of Data Stewardship (Cont.) {.smaller}

-   Without successful data management & curation, data analysis is not
    possible, it would be prohibitively expensive and and dangerously
    unreliable

-   Data Stewardship is the larger part of data science.

-   Not only Data Stewardship is essential for reliable efficient
    analysis, but most of the cost associated with using data is, by
    far, in management & curation, not analysis, and most of the
    workforce needs are, also by far, in management & curation, not
    analysis.

| *Ask any data manager in industry will tell you, it is the management & curatorial work where they make the largest investment, of money, staff, time, and effort*

## Broader Activities {.smaller}

`Some of the broader activites in Data Stewardship includes:`

![](images/activites.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
1.  **Collection:** It includes support for, e.g., coordination of
    instrument calibration, protocols, procedures, collection area
    division, interview transcription, etc. Of particular importance it
    records information (as metadata) related to collection activity so
    that all relevant aspects of context are available later to support
    full understanding, authentication, and provenance.

2.  **Organization:**

-   It determine an appropriate data model and schema
-   Use abstraction and indirection to manage data
-   Identify and use any relevant standards for both syntax and
    semantics
-   Of particular importance:
    -   Document schema attributes (including specifying datatypes and
        constraints).
    -   Document all changes to schemas.
    -   Maintain metadata for schema changes.

3.  **Storage:** Select storage strategies that proved the right mix of
    reliability, security and access

4.  **Preservation:** Maintain a documented preservation strategy. This
    includes not just bit sequence preservation and syntax
    documentation, but also the documentation of semantics for data
    elements and the generation and preservation of all metadata needed
    to ensure that the data is useable and understandable, and can be
    authenticated and audited for provenance. Execute that strategy with
    discipline, documenting all actions taken.

5.  **Discoverability:**

-   Develop metadata to support searching for and finding relevant data
    in relevant formats.
-   Support searching that provide relevance ranking and recommends
    related datasets

6.  **Access:**

-   Maintain systems, tools, and metadata that support the efficient and
    reliable retrieval and distribution of data
-   Add metadata describing file formats
-   Where appropriate control access appropriately and maintain data on
    distribution and access

7.  **Workflow:**

-   The processing of data should be carried out a well-designed modular
    system of transformations.
-   The role of each module should be documented.
-   The execution of a workflow should be documented as well.
-   To the greatest extent possible documentation should be generated
    automatically and should itself be both machine readable and
    executable.
-   Specifically: well-maintained scripts should be developed and used
    to document as well as execute data transformations

8.  **Identification:**

-   Identifier systems must be carefully designed. Attention must be
    given to what (conceptually) is being identified and to the method
    of identification.
-   Related entities (such as the data abstractly and the same data
    represented in different formats) must be both precisely
    distinguished and precisely related.
-   Version control for format changes, corrections, etc. must be
    implemented.
-   Authentication (the data is in fact the data it claims to be) and
    validation (the schema constraints, syntax and semantics, are met)
    are both fundamental.

9.  **Integration:**

-   Both variations in syntax and data element semantics must be
    accommodated if data from multiple sources is to be combined and
    related to solve real world problems.
-   Use schema alignment and cross-walking techniques to integrate data.
-   Document integration strategies in detail so that any conflation,
    data loss, etc. is noted.

10. **Reformatting:**

-   Data must frequently be reformatted in order to support new tools,
    new versions of existing tools, or to meet new format standards.
-   Reformatting must be documented and any changes in semantics or
    meaning must be identified.

11. **Reproducibility**: It includes documenting not only data
    collection and management, but also documenting processing and
    analysis

12. **Sharing:** There are many obstacles to data sharing, ranging from
    formats, to lack of documentation, to concerns about misuse or
    misunderstanding. Data stewardship must address these, typically
    with policies, documentation, metadata, and interoperable systems.

13. **Communication:** To be useful data must be presented in forms that
    provide insight (such as scientific visualizations) and integrated
    clearly and efficiently into the full life-cycle of scientific work,
    which includes scientific publishing. Related communication issues
    are relevant to other data stewardship activities: in entertainment,
    documentation, services, etc. Here data stewardship overlaps with
    interface design.

14. **Provenance:** When one data set (or view) is derived from another,
    reliable use and understanding requires that the inputs,
    calculations, and actions responsible for data values can be
    identified.

15. **Modification:**

-   Data must be updated and corrected.
-   This must be supported and managed so that errors are not introduced
    but so that the changes overtime can be tracked and audited.

16. **Compliance:** The issues here range from intellectual property
    rights to regulations regarding the privacy of medical, financial,
    and personal information.

17. **Security:** This will involve methods for controlling access and
    determining user identity and privileges, as well as data identity,
    authentication and validation.

## Data Stewardship: Methods of Action {.smaller}

1.  `Analysis`: To determine needs, and develop relevant data models and
    metadata, and reformat, correct, or update data.
2.  `Documentation`: To record essential information (typically via
    metadata)
3.  `System design and implementation`: To support all data curatorial
    activities To support the generation and use of data documentation
    and processing documentation
4.  `Policy`: To specify objectives, procedures, practices, and formats.
5.  `Process`: To ensure success and efficiency by managing the
    development of appropriate organizational units and roles, providing
    training, advocating for change, and managing curatorial activities.

# What is Data?

::: notes
Ever check the weather before leaving your house or scroll through
social media feeds? These are some everyday examples of data in use.

Data is information made up of statistics and facts that can be used for
analysis and making decisions. In this course, when we talk about data,
we're referring to data that is mainly collected and stored
electronically.

So let's ask ourselves, **how does data impact our lives?**

Data helps us find our way in the world, literally. Like when we use
navigation apps to avoid traffic jams. We use weather forecasts to plan
how we dress for the day, to stay warm, or to decide if this weekend is
a good one for an outdoor event.

Many of us have apps that track and monitor our steps and heart rate,
motivating us to meet our fitness goals. Online stores use data to
personalize our shopping experiences ever noticed recommended products
after viewing something similar in an online store? That's data analysis
at work, suggesting items you might also be interested in.

Video streaming services track your viewing habits, recommending movies
and shows based on your previous viewing history, and music apps do the
same using our listing histories. Data is used all the time to
personalize your entertainment, making it more enjoyable.

Data's impact on our lives can reach beyond personal fitness, shopping
and entertainment. It's also used by organizations of all sizes to help
figure out things like future staffing needs, where to construct new
roads and bridges, or even for helping to decide how to treat illnesses.
Data has a powerful impact on our lives.

#### [***We are filled with data in today's networked society***]{style="color: blue;"}

-   through our web activity, we are assigned *gender, ethnicity, class,
    age, education level, and potential status of parent with x no. of
    children* ([digital trace data/digital footprint/digital
    breadcrumbs]{style="color: orange;"})

-   if internet metadata identifies a user as foreigner than they lose
    right to privacy afforded to U.S. citizens

-   who would have thought that [*class status, citizenship,
    ethnicity*]{.underline} could be algorithmically understood?

::: notes
In the last slide, you learn what data is and explored some examples of
how data affects our lives. Now, we will look at the data from a
critical lens.

We need to keep in mind about data is that while data can be used to
benefit us, we can also need to have a say about how it's collected and
used.

Many platforms allow you to control your privacy settings. An example is
how mobile platforms like Apple's iOS make the information shared with
apps more transparent to the user. We should all become familiar with
how our data gets used and make conscious decisions about what we allow.

The data shared by such platforms can generate biases in algorithms that
we use daily through social networking apps (Facebook, X, Instagram,
etc.) or just searching through internet!

By understanding the power of data in our lives, we can leverage it for
good and ensure our privacy is respected.
:::

## We are Data (Cont.) {.smaller}

#### [***We live in a world of ubiquitous networked communication***]{style="color: blue;"}

-   technologies that constituent the Internet are so woven into the
    fabric of our daily lives, where for most of us, existing without
    seems unimaginable

#### [***We also live in a world of ubiquitous surveillance***]{style="color: blue;"}

-   same technologies have helped spawn an impressive network of
    governmental, commercial, and unaffiliated infrastructures of mass
    observation and control
-   most of what we do in this world has at least the **capacity** to be
    *observed, recorded, analyzed, and stored* in a databank
    -   HOW?
        -   storage is cheap
        -   computers are fast to analyze information in both real time
            & retrospective
        -   our daily activities that are mediated with software can be
            easily configured to record and report everything it sees
            upstream

::: notes
Ever wonder how Netflix or Amazon Prime know which movie or show to
recommend or how your vehicle's GPS knows how to navigate you around
traffic?

It's data!

Let's explore some examples of how data can play an essential role in
everyday decisions.

Imagine you're stuck in traffic. You open a navigation app and it
re-routes you based on real time traffic data. This data collected from
other users and sensors helps the app make an informed decision about
the fastest route for you to take.

Data plays a vital role in healthcare too. Doctors use patient data such
as medical history and test results to diagnose illnesses and determine
the best course of treatment.

Data is also a powerful tool for scientific research. Scientists collect
data on everything from weather patterns to animal behavior. By
analyzing this data, they can make predictions and develop new
technologies and strategies to manage real world problems.

Businesses also use data to make decisions. For example, marketing teams
use customer data to understand their audience and target their
advertising campaigns. This data helps them reach the right people with
the right message at the right time.

Even our cities use data to improve the lives of their residents. City
planners use data on population density, traffic patterns, and resource
usage to inform plans for building and managing the city's
infrastructure and public transportation systems.

So the next time you see a movie recommendation or navigate through
smooth traffic, remember that data is working behind the scenes, helping
you and countless others daily. The world of data is vast and ever
evolving, but one thing is certain, data is a powerful tool that can be
used to improve our lives in countless ways. We will examine the types
of data and the various ways in which data is collected later.

## Data Lifecycle

![](images/clipboard-2779466639.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

::: footer
[Digital Curation Centre (DCC) Lifecycle Model
(UK)](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/%20guidance/curation-lifecycle-model)
:::

::: notes
The data lifecycle refers to the numerous phases of data as it is
collected, curated, analysed, used, decommissioned, and iteratively
reviewed within the larger AI project lifecycle to ensure accurate,
secure, and robust performance of an AI/ML system. Integral to every
stage of the data lifecycle is responsible data stewardship.

The Digital Curation Center has developed the curation lifecycle model
shown on the slide. The model illustrates the processes as data are
created. The outermost ring illustrates the research process, which can
be extended to other contexts as well. For example, a research project
is conceptualized. Data is created or received, appraised and selected,
ingested into a system, preserved and stored in a database or other
computerized storage. Later it is accessed and re-used by the original
creators or by other audiences. Finally it is transformed into other
data or publication.

In later modules, you will learn the essential processes for organizing
the data within the cycle in depth.

## Data Management Across Research Lifecycle

![](images/clipboard-3439982391.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

::: notes
Again, we will cover about Research Data and its Management in detail in
later modules.

This slide summarizes a typical research data lifecycle showing how data
undergo the subsequent stages of processing, analyzing, preserving,
accessing, and reusing.
:::

## Data Visualization

`Why Create Visualizations Generally?`

![](images/clipboard-2612812196.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

::: notes
Data visualization helps the user make sense of large (and often times
small) amounts of data using computational and analytic tools. In
academic and special libraries data visualization helps researchers and
business users recognize and understand the “patterns” in the data to
assist them in decision making, research, product development,
marketing, and other uses not yet realized.

Along with the emergence of “big data” came the need for more visual
means to analyze and make sense of the data. Visualization also allows
for re-purposing of datasets beyond their original use.

Information professionals assist in data visualization but also in
managing and preparing the data for use.

An academic library may title these professionals as *Data analysis
librarian, Data manager, Digital Projects librarian/specialist*, etc.
The titles are emerging as fast as the visualization tools themselves.
Special librarians have always conducted data analysis and competitive
intelligence for their companies. Data visualization is an extension of
this service to their user community.

Information professionals also use data visualization themselves for
innovative ways to present information to users, to market their
services, and to synthesize data for stakeholders.
