# Introduction

::: notes
Welcome to the Forever Frogs exercise. This is a self paced exercise.
You can complete it at your own speed.

So, let’s get started.

I have brought a very special collection of objects for you to work
with. Feel free to browse the slides at your own pace.

The collection currently is about 300 items, though for the purpose of
this exercise, think about the collection as being in a retail location
and consisting of well over 1,000 items of various formats.
:::

## Our Collection: Forever Frogs {.smaller}

-   Forever Frogs is a retail store that sells artistic representations
    of frogs, just frogs, everything froggy. It is located in an upscale
    village square of a progressive community in the Midwest. The
    collection contains several formats, for example:
    -   Garden sculpture
    -   Children’s toys
    -   Fiction and nonfiction books
    -   Realia, images, paintings, etc.
    -   Music
    -   Robots and other electronics
    -   Clothing
-   Because the owners are so terribly busy traveling the world to find
    all things froggy, they do not have the time to design an
    organization system for the collection. Your task is to model on
    paper the ideal organization system for Forever Frogs.

::: notes
You have been commissioned to create an organization system for the
retail store, Forever Frogs. The store is located in an upscale village
square of a progressive community in the Midwest.

The collection contains several formats (as you will view on the next
slides), for example:

-   Garden sculpture

-   Children’s toys

-   Fiction and nonfiction books

-   Realia, images, paintings, etc.

-   Music Robots and other electronics

-   Clothing

::: notes
Who knew garden art could be so cute and so froggy? This object is made
of tin and has been painted brown, two shades of green and some red. He
is about 8 inches long and 6 inches high and is designed to sit in the
garden or on a table in the sun. He doesn’t catch flies though.

![](images/clipboard-822985633.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

::: notes
This object is in three pieces. It is a salt and pepper shaker set. It
is ceramic and painted green, yellow, orange, brown and some grays. It
is about 3 inches high and 4 inches wide. It is also about 50 years old.
:::

## 

![](images/clipboard-2530177890.png){fig-align="center" width="294"}

::: notes
This is Bob. He is a bobble-head toy frog that children will love to
play with. He depicts a red-eyed tree frog. See later slides for more on
Bob.

He is also the owners’ favorite.
:::

## 

![](images/clipboard-3932866239.png){width="90%"}

::: notes
Some frogs are not only beautiful but also have a specific function to
fulfill. This little one is a jewelry box. It is cloisonné, painted
reds, pinks, greens, yellow and white. It is about 2.5 inches high and 3
inches long. The top comes off completely to reveal a golden interior
for storage.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-4275463228.png)

::: notes
This object is also a jewelry box, though it is smaller and really only
will fit a ring or a small set of earrings. The lid lifts back flat to
reveal a gold interior. It is also cloisonné and painted green, gold,
read, and has jewels for eyes. Detail includes a small gold butterfly.
It is about 2 inches high and 2 inches long.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-1330986391.png)

::: notes
This object is very unique. It is a ring holder, so it has one specific
purpose. It is brass, painted blue, green, red and some gold. The top
frog and lilly pad lift off to slide the ring on. It is about 5 inches
tall and the base is 1.25 inches across.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-3562892180.png)

::: notes
What a great picture frame for your own works of art! This object is
about 5 inches high and about 1.5 inches wide. The back can be removed
to insert pictures. It is painted green and silver and has jewel eyes.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-669335089.png)

::: notes
Doesn’t everyone love robots? Well here is a robot frog. He hops, sings,
dances, and catches flies. What more could you want? (His tongue
actually extends to catch a fly off of a branch) He is 10 inches high,
14 inches long and made of green and silver plastic. His tongue is pink
plastic. He needs four C batteries to work and has a remote to control
the functions.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-4024237819.png){width="85%"}

::: notes
This is Ben. He is a plush puppet. He is soft, furry, and green, yellow,
and orange. He has wonderful expressive red and black eyes. He has a
sound box that allows him to croak if squeezed just right. He is about
12 inches long and 8 inches wide. He is very cuddly.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-551990712.png)

::: notes
Here is an nonfiction book about frogs and their development. The
pictures are in color and the book is 8.5 x 11 inches. More about this
book later.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-1370068036.png)

::: notes
Can you believe an autobiography? This book contains the diary of a frog
during its life and seasons. The pictures are all in color, it is
hardbound, and 15 inches wide, 10 inches long.
:::

## ![](images/clipboard-1088341698.png)

::: notes
This work is a wonderful old book about myths, legends, and lore about
frogs. The pictures are very detailed and in black and white, sepia, and
color. It is hardbound, 10 inches high x 8 inches wide. The stories are
unique and it is a must to any froggy collection.

The last slides have shown you a representative sample of this diverse
collection. As mentioned earlier you should view it as containing over
1,000 objects.

Now let’s talk about how to begin modeling the system for this
collection.
:::

## Entity First Level

![](images/clipboard-459783283.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Each object in the collection will be represented at one or many
    entity levels
-   In this case `one level` is appropriate. The whole object level.
    This means that I will have `one` record in my system for
    `each object`.

::: notes
First let’s consider the entity level. You might recall from the Module
2 lecture that the entity level is the “chunk” or portion of the object
we are representing within one record in our system. Libraries tend to
work at the whole object level and represent one book or dvd with one
record in the system.

This is what we call the whole object entity level. Some collections
have more than one level represented. For example, a collection of music
cd’s might be represented at the whole object level (album) or it could
also be represented at both the album and the song level. It you choose
to have more than one level, your system (field structure) needs to be
able to accommodate both levels.

So, the first step in the modeling of the objects is to determine the
entity level. For our collection we will work at the whole object level.
:::

## Next Let’s Talk About Attributes

![](images/clipboard-459783283.png){fig-align="center"}

> Bob is a bobble-head toy or artifact that can sit on a shelf. He is 4
> inches tall, 6 inches long, and is green, gold, blue and red. He
> represents a red-eyed tree frog. He has soft, felt on his body. He has
> a moving head that bobs when you touch it. He was made by Zoologics
> Inc.

::: notes
Now we can talk about attributes.

Attributes are the general characteristics of objects. When I say
“general”, I mean that we are looking for characteristics that are
represented by the objects in the collection but at the least specific
level.

Bob is described more above. From the description and your observation,
you can begin to pick out the attributes that describe Bob, but that
also describe the other objects in the collection.
:::

## Attributes for Bob?

![](images/clipboard-459783283.png){fig-align="center"}

> `Bob` is a `bobble-head toy` or artifact that can sit on a shelf. He
> is `4 inches tall`, `6 inches long`, and is `green, gold, and red`. He
> represents a `red-eyed tree frog`. He has `soft, felt` on his body. He
> has a `moving head` that bobs when you touch it. He was
> `made by Zoologics Inc`.

::: notes
I have highlighted the attributes I can identify from the description of
Bob. These describe the Name, Physical Description, Creator and Subject.
:::

## Attributes for Bob?

-   `Bob` -- his **Name**
-   `bobble-head toy` -- is his **Format**
-   `4 inches tall, 6 inches long` -- is his **Size**
-   `green, gold, and red` -- is his **Color**
-   `red-eyed tree frog` -- is the **Subject? Species? Style?**
-   `soft, felt` -- is his **Texture**
-   `moving head made by Zoologics Inc.` -- is his **Creator
    (manufacturer)**

::: notes
Here is another way to look at attributes. Most, if not all objects,
will have a Name. For books we think of this as Title. For 3-D objects
we think of this as Name so let’s stick with Name so that we can
generally describe the objects.

For Bob we also have Format. He is a toy. We could also include this
attribute under Physical Description if we like.

Physical Description includes: Color, Texture, Size, etc. For books we
might think of number of pages, dimension, material made of, etc.

He was made by a company called Zoologics. This is a Creator attribute.
We could structure this into a field called Manufacturer later, or
Publisher for books. Creator, again allows us to generally describe the
objects in the collection.

## Attributes for Books? {.smaller}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![![](images/clipboard-1323061874.png)](images/clipboard-2884194949.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   *If I were a frog* = `NAME`
-   *Sherry Been* = `CREATOR`
-   *Reader’s Digest Childrens Publishers Inc.* = `CREATOR`
-   *Autobiography* = `SUBJECT`
-   *Frogs* = `SUBJECT`
-   *Book* = `FORMAT`
:::
:::

::: notes
Books are a little easier to extract attributes. A book has a Creator
(author, publisher, illustrator, etc.), it has a Name (we think of
Title), Subject, and Physical Description.

+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

::: notes
Now let’s take what we just discussed and model the attributes into a
table.

The first column includes the attributes we extracted from the objects
in the collection. Again, think about the representative sample of
objects you are using to illustrate the collection. This table only
shows a few we discussed for Bob and for books. You will need to include
ALL in your project.

The second column includes the field or field names that your attributes
becomes in the system structure (metadata scheme). These can be a one to
one or one to many relationship, meaning one attribute can become one or
many fields in the system.

For example, the Creator attribute is expressed in the system design as
three fields. It could even be more if you want to include Illustrator
information. The Name attribute has been expressed here as two fields
but you could opt to include only one field, using Name as the general
field name to accommodate all potential issues with naming the various
formats of objects.

The third column is where you show your decision of whether or not to
make a field searchable. If you want a field to be searchable within the
system, you have to index it. That in turn tells the system that an
inverted index should be created by the system.

It also tells the system to make that field available for searching.
When someone then uses the system and they search the Name field, they
are ONLY searching the inverted index for the Name field. Your indexing
decisions should be based upon what you know about your users and how
they use the collection.

The last column is to illustrate if the field is related to the physical
aspects (container aspects) or the subject (content aspects) of the
object.

## Implementation of Data Model

![](images/clipboard-2349705143.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Now that we have our system field structure (metadata scheme) in place,
let’s think about creating a record for one of our objects. The table
above shows you how the record might appear in the system. Note that not
all fields have values assigned to them. Name is not related to this
object, but Title is, so we ONLY fill in the Title field.

We can either leave the Name field (and all other unused fields) blank
or we can write into our rule to include a statement like “Not
applicable”. The point here, is that you can have blank fields in a
record. You also have to make it clear in your rule if this is the case
or if a special statement should instead be entered into the field.
:::

## Bob’s Record in the System {.smaller}

-   Record ID: 0001

-   Name: Bob

-   Manufacturer: ZooLogics Inc.

-   Format: toy

-   Size: 6 inches long, 4 inches high

-   Color: green, gold, red

-   Features: movable head

-   Subject: red-eyed tree frog

-   Function: entertainment

-   Image:![](images/clipboard-3989374908.png)

::: notes
Here is what Bob’s record might look like in your system. Each field’s
value will be created following the input rules you create for each
field in the system.

I have included an image field so that the “Forever Frogs” customers
could see the object before they go to the trouble of locating the toy
in the store. You can also include an image field if important to your
users and their system use.

You have successfully designed an information organization
system—beginning with a setting, a collection, and potential users. You
then used this information to develop a data model of the system. You
would then implement the data model in a field structure, created input
rules for each field, and then use both the structure and the input
rules to create records to describe the objects in the collection.

CONGRATULATIONS!
